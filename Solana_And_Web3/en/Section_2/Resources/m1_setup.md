We are in the process of writing a full write up of this! Until then, our very own TA, Nick, made a nice write up of how to get this going which you can [checkout here](https://chartreuse-freeze-f9f.notion.site/Mac-M1-Solana-Guide-71371198056f45ed8d1f8c77cba99c73).

**When you get through this section, make sure to show Nick some love in Discord (Nick_G#4818)**
